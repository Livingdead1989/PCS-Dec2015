            <h3>Our Chef <small>- Steven Cross</small></h3>
            <p>Cooking has always been our Head Chef’s passion and from a very young age Steven Cross cooked at home with his mother, who is also a chef.  After leaving school he went straight to South Downs College where he studied catering for four years.</p>

            <p>Steven relished his time studying at college. He was rewarded with work placements in Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, where he worked alongside some very talented chefs.</p>

            <p>On leaving college Steven focused on gaining experience at the highest level and worked within AA rosetted establishments and Michelin star restaurants. Although extremely hard work, Steven loved the challenge.  Steven worked in such places as 36 On The Quay in Emsworth and JSW in Petersfield.</p>

            <p>On joining Park Community School, Steven’s focus was to redefine school meals and ensure all our students got a healthy well balanced meal throughout the school day. Steven worked tirelessly to set up Park Catering Services and he is proud to say that good food for all has successfully been embedded within the school’s ethos.</p>

            <p>Steven runs the school farm growing a large percentage of our own fruit and vegetables which are used within the school kitchens.  We have also reared more than 80 pigs on the farm, the meat from which has been used for school lunches.  Steven has been instrumental in forging links with local food producers to increase our organic produce usage.</p>

            <p>Looking to the future, Steven is now developing Park Catering Services to help our students and community to understand how to grow their own food, food processes and benefits of a healthy nutritious diet.</p>
