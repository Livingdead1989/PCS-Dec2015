            <p>Homework is a significant way through which we increase students’ <strong>Understanding</strong> and <strong>Mastery</strong> of content and skills, and raise standards.</p>

            <p>The expectations of new exam syllabuses and a move to terminal examinations in all subjects over the next three years, means that students must be supported to consolidate, review and revise learning outside of lessons in order to fully master the knowledge and skills they require. Homework is a vital part of this.</p>
