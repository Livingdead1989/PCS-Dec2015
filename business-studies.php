                    	<h3>Intent</h3>
                   			 <p>Whether you are planning to enter fashion or finance, or something in-between, here are six key reasons why you should study business and how it can open a world of possibilities for you.</p>
                   			 <p>The Pearson Edexcel GCSE in Business has been designed to provide a focused academic qualification. The qualification will provide students with the knowledge, understanding and skills necessary to prepare them for employment or higher education. The course has an essential core of knowledge and applied skills. The essential core gives learners the opportunity to gain a broad understanding and knowledge of small to medium business sectors.</p>
                   			 <p>Overall, the course has been developed to encourage students’ personal development of knowledge and skills relevant to the business world through practical participation in a range of business activities designed to complement the theory concepts required at GCSE.</p>

                   			 <p>The course will:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Give students an understanding of what we mean by entrepreneurship and the skills and qualities that an entrepreneur needs in order to set up a successful business</li>
									<li>Develop an understanding of the key functional areas in a business e.g. marketing, finance, human resources and operations management</li>
									<li>Learn more about the world we live in and how changes in the economic environment affect people and UK businesses</li>
									<li>To develop examination skills e.g. interpreting data, developing an analytical argument, making judgements based on available evidence etc.</li>
									<li>Develop an appreciation of moral and ethical issues related to the operation of a business e.g. the use of child labour in the fashion industry</li>
								</ul>


							<h3>Implementation</h3>
                   			 <p>At Park Community school our Business studies department operates a 2-year course, starting with the introduction to Small Business start-ups in Year 10, which then leads to employment and legal aspects in Year 11, students then develop their knowledge of business calculations and exam technique are reviewed and improved prior to the final exams. The classes will normally have six lessons each, over a fortnight and all students should experience most of these activities:</p>
                   			 	<ul>
									<li>Discussion – one to one or small groups</li>
									<li>Research – group or individual using a variety of methods</li>
									<li>Report writing – such as analysis of business ideas then justification for a chosen pathway</li>
									<li>Presentations – generally in groups, designed to increase confidence</li>
									<li>Marketing – group or individual activities backed by market research</li>
								</ul>
								
                   			 <p>The specification looks at the issues in starting up a business and then in a larger growing firm. It focuses on the key functional areas of Marketing, Finance, Human Resources and Operations. The course provides students with a holistic view of the major issues that face modern businesses.</p>
						


						<h3>Progression</h3>
						<p>A qualification in business will:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>enable students to understand more about the business world</li>
								<li>motivate and challenge students, and prepare them to make informed decisions about further study and career pathways</li>
							</ul>

						<p>Students can progress from this qualification to a number of different academic and vocational qualifications at Level 3, including GCEs in Business, History, Geography, Economics and Psychology and BTEC Nationals in Business.</p>

						<p>The knowledge and skills gained from GCSE Business support students’ entry into employment or other training in specific aspects of business, such as apprenticeships and vocational qualifications which focus on more specialised business areas.</p>
						<p>GCSE Business provides a strong foundation for employment, with students progressing, with further training, to a wide range of careers training such as banking, sales, product management and general management.</p>
