            <p>We are keen to introduce practical, hands-on courses for students who wish to work in the trades industries, whilst ensuring that curriculum requirements are met.</p>
            <p>The recent government changes to school examinations and accreditations dictate that from 2016 non-academic courses have no ‘league table value’ to schools. A consequence of this is that schools now need to ensure any time spent on vocational learning is highly relevant to the student’s needs.</p>

            <p>Park Community Enterprises Ltd have leased facilities named The Apex Centre, to accommodate this. This Centre is situated to the north east of the central shopping district of Leigh Park and is within fifteen minutes walking distance from Park Community School. It is within the school’s catchment area. The Apex Centre is just two minutes walk from the industrial unit we already lease.</p>
