            <p>We are keen to introduce practical, hands-on courses for students who wish to work in the trades industries, whilst ensuring that curriculum requirements are met.</p>
            <p>The recent government changes to school examinations and accreditations dictate that from 2016 non-academic courses have no ‘league table value’ to schools. A consequence of this is that schools now need to ensure any time spent on vocational learning is highly relevant to a student’s needs.</p>
            <p>Park Community Enterprises Ltd has leased facilities named The Apex Centre, to accommodate this. This Centre is situated to the north east of the central shopping district of Leigh Park and is within fifteen minutes walking distance from Park Community School. It is within the school’s catchment area. The Apex Centre is just two minutes walk from the industrial unit we already lease.</p>

            <p>The student can undertake a construction skills course leading to a Laser Level 1 in Construction Skills. The qualification is a Certification for Learning, Employability and Progression (LEAP). The course will take 60 sessions over a 2-year period to complete depending on ability.</p>
            <p>The units of study will include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Brickwork/Blockwork</li>
              <li>Painting</li>
              <li>Carpentry</li>
              <li>Plastering</li>
              <li>Construction</li>
              <li>Health and Safety</li>
              <li>Measurements of distance and length</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We believe we are best placed to address these needs of our students and other providers who are not yet aware of the implications of the forthcoming changes.</p>
