            <h3>Purpose of Study</h3>
            <p>Photography at Park enables students to explore a range of lens-based media techniques and processes. This will include theme based photography such as portraiture, landscape or still life, alongside aspects of exploring imagery and film.</p>

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <ul class="circle">
                <li>To develop and refine ideas through investigation.</li>
                <li>To record ideas and insights relevant to their intentions in visual forms.</li>
                <li>To present a personal response demonstrating analytical and critical understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Areas of Study</h3>
            <p>Unit 1 consists of an introduction to photography, focusing on aspects of composition, how a camera works and exploring the history and development of Photography over the years. Research on a range of photographers from contemporary through to historical artists is compiled and then applied to their own portfolios.</p>
            <p>Unit 2 consists of exam preparation through the development of analytical and evaluative skills to enable a detailed response set by the board. This will include refining their photographic skills and building up their portfolio in order to achieve their full potential.</p>
