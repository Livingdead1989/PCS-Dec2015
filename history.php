        <h3>Key Stage 3 - Year 7</h3>
        <p>Timeless themes that run through the course of history forms the structure of our Key Stage 3 curriculum; within this, there is a clear chronology that
        allows pupils to develop their sense of time. In Year 7, the first theme studied is ‘ordinary lives’.</p>
        <p>This unit sees the study of:</p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>how did toilets change in British history?</li>
          <li>the significance of the Battle of Hastings</li>
          <li>life as a Medieval peasant and how we interpret their daily routines</li>
          <li>the Black Death and its dramatic consequences in reshaping society</li>
          <li>Shakespeare’s England, examining the rise of leisure pursuits such as the theatre</li>
          <li>an examination of industrial Britain and whether this was really progress for ‘ordinary’ people</li>
          <li>how life dramatically changed during the 20th century and which factors we attribute to this</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second theme for our year seven pupils is focused on ‘why were people willing to die for their beliefs’. This includes the importance of religion in Medieval life and the turbulent changes in Tudor England that arose from England’s dramatic break with Rome in the 16th century and the consequences of this.</p>
        <p>Finally, the theme of ‘power’ is studied. This follows the changes in kingship from Medieval to Tudor England and then the subsequent progress
        and change from monarchy to a democratic system that we have today.</p>

        <h3>Key Stage - Year 8</h3>
        <p>Our Year 8 programme of study looks at how democracy and civil rights were won and lost in Britain and Germany in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including
        Hitler’s rise to power and a depth-study on the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>The second term focuses on modern history with the focus on conflict in the nineteenth and twentieth century. In this unit, pupils’ research key
        developments and events that have shaped our society today; this includes</p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>the women’s suffrage movement in Britain</li>
          <li>the two world wars and their significance</li>
          <li>how the terrorist attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup> marks a turning point in modern history</li>
        </ul>


        <p>In addition, pupils will have the opportunity to investigate their local history to help them connect with a more personal history and help them to
        understand the immediate world around them.</p>

        <h3>Key Stage 4</h3>

        <p>Key Stage 4 students are currently completing a three year course in GCSE History. Paper 1 focuses on Crime and Punishment over the course of a thousand years, starting in 1000AD. Within this topic, there is a section solely focused on the historic place of Whitechapel during the late 19th century which includes the crimes of Jack the Ripper.</p>
        <p>Paper 2 Section A is a unit on Superpower Relations 1941-1991 which examines the nuclear stand-off between the USA and Russia that dominated international affairs in the latter part of the 20th century. Section B of this paper is Elizabethan England 1558-1588 is the depth study of choice, studying the problems she encountered in her long reign and how these were dealt with.</p>
        <p>Paper 3 solely focuses on a modern depth study of Weimar and Nazi Germany, examining Hitler’s rise to power and how life changed for ordinary people in this period. This varied and thought-provoking curriculum is designed to give pupils both depth and breadth of a range of areas to allow them to truly value the lessons from the past and enjoy their learning.</p>
