            <h3>Intent</h3>
                    <p>Science has something to offer every student, suiting all abilities and all aspirations. Our aim is to develop worldly citizens through boosting cultural capital.</p>
                    <p>During KS3 in science, we promote awe and wonder. We want our students to be curious about the world around them and be confident to ask questions and investigate a range of possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Our curriculum is designed to build upon the learning in KS2 and enable students to develop the necessary skills when working as a scientist. Vocabulary is very important in science and we develop the amount of science specific words learnt by students and ensure these are practised by orally and in written work.</p>
                    <p>Once at KS4, we build upon the key skills and knowledge learnt in KS3 and continue to master these and apply to a range of contexts.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p>We fully promote literacy and use fortnightly news articles on current issues/stories to promote cultural capital in KS3 and to allow students to understand the world around them. In KS3, we currently complete termly awe and wonder specific lessons; these are designed to allow exploration of students own questions.</p>
                    <p>We have a centralised SOW designed to ensure NC covered with appropriate levels of challenge. Includes working scientifically skills to be covered and assessed. For KS4, we have a centralised SOW designed to ensure AQA specification is covered from grades 1-9.</p>
                    <p>We improve and master the working scientifically skills built upon from KS3, while covering the required practical elements of the course.</p>
                    <p>Clear focus on expanding scientific vocabulary to ensure fluency in both written and verbal answers.</p>
                    <p>Fully embedded maths skills that are required, with clear links with maths methods and vocabulary used.</p>
                     
            <br>

                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>During KS3, we want students who ready for KS4 with necessary skills and knowledge to build upon and are ‘GCSE ready’.</p>
                    <p>Students have high aspirations and enjoyment of science when leaving KS3 and students are able to achieve age related expectations (ARE) or above and are fully prepared for their GCSE.</p>
                    <p>Once in KS4, our aim is to increase the number of students going onto study a science subject at higher education.</p>
