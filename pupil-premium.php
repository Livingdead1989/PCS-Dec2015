          <p>In 2015/2016 the school received £446,093 for Pupil Premium (PP) plus £12,700 for Children in Care.</p>
          <p>The school spent £500,275 providing additional support for PP students.  The pupil premium is grant funding and is in addition to the school’s Delegated Budget.</p>
          <p>The Pupil Premium is allocated by calculating the number of students who are on Free School Meals (FSM) or have had FSM in the last six years.  Students who have been in care continuously for more than six months or have a parent in the Armed Services also lead to some additional funding for the school.</p>
