          <p>Grant Allocation:</p>
          <p>In 2015/2016 the school received £446,093 for Pupil Premium (PP) plus £12,700 for Children in Care.</p>
          <p>The school spent £500,275 providing additional support for PP students. The pupil premium is grant funding and is in addition to the school’s Delegated Budget. The school chooses to invest additional funding from its delegated budget to support pupil premium funding.</p>
          <p>The Pupil Premium is allocated by calculating the number of students who are on Free School Meals (FSM) or have had FSM in the last six years. Students who have been in care continuously for more than six months or have a parent in the Armed Services also lead to some additional funding for the school.</p>

          <h3>How Pupil Premium is spent to address these barriers</h3>
          <p>The Pupil Premium spent is used to raise attainment, autonomy and resilience, promote social skills, independent learning and positive behaviour, in order to increase student progress.</p>
          <p>54% of students in Year 11 in 2015/2016 qualified for PP. In 2016 the gap in achievement between not PP and PP students in their GCSE results was 0.02 for Progress 8 (PP -0.12, Not PP -0.14). The gap between Not PP and PP students achieving English and Maths A*-C was 6%. 42% of PP were entered for English Baccalaureate.</p>

        <h4>Catch-up Funding for Year 7 2015-2016</h4>
        <p>In 2015 - 2016 we received £20,500 catch up funding which was used to provide:</p>
        <p>One to One reading, spelling and literacy intervention for 33 Year 7 students - with some students being in receipt of more than 1 round of intervention.</p>
        <p>Additional classroom support for one class.</p>
        <p>In total more than 41 students benefitted from this intervention. The impact of this support was measured through: student and parent feedback, Year 7 progress data, reading and spelling data.</p>
        <p>All students receiving intervention demonstrated improvement in their reading with 24 making double ratio gains. Alongside this, 25 students also made progress in both their spelling and reading with 19 continuing to make further above chronological gains demonstrating the mastery of key skills enabling them to continue to make progress.</p>
        <p>Parent and student feedback demonstrated positive increases regarding confidence and perception of ability alongside willingness to engage in additional learning outside of the classroom.</p>
        <p>Any future funding will be used to help these students secure and close gaps in their literacy or numeracy through small group intervention, 1 to 1 intervention and in class support.</p>
