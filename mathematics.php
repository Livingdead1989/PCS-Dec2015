            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Mathematics is a creative and highly inter-connected problem solving discipline developed over centuries. Through history, mathematics has been essential for solving some of the most intriguing problems and today it is just as necessary for everyday life. Although we now have technological advances to solve many difficult calculations, these are a direct result of mathematical knowledge and the need for mathematical thinking in science, technology and engineering.</p>

            <p>The mathematics curriculum provides a foundation for understanding, and develops reasoning ability, whilst also developing enjoyment and curiosity about the subject.</p>

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p>We aim to develop pupils’ understanding of key mathematical concepts and processes in order to enable pupils to solve problems using a variety of techniques and skills. This requires pupils to be fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics and to reason mathematically. This is turn happens through repeated practise to increase fluency and mastery, application of skills to familiar and unfamiliar contexts, learning of formulae, application to calculations, analysis and interpretation of mathematical information, as well as contextualising and applying appropriate elements to situations within which pupils are familiar.</p>
            
            <h3>Areas of Study</h3>
            <ul class="circle">
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Algebra</li>
                <li>Ratio, Proportion and Rates of Change</li>
                <li>Geometry and measures: learn and apply formulae in order to calculate problems.</li>
                <li>Probability</li>
                <li>Statistics</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Year 7</strong> – All year 7 pupils start secondary mathematics with strong links to STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics).  This enables pupils to develop a depth of understanding for core operations + - × ÷ with strong links to physical application to support their understanding of core concepts.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Stage 3</strong> - Throughout Key Stage 3, all pupils study mathematics covering the full spectrum of Number, Calculating, Algebra, Geometry and Statistics. These sit alongside Mathematical Processes and Applications and Functional mathematics in order to develop independent mathematicians with skills transferable to other subject areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Stage 4</strong> - All pupils are studying a Linear GCSE mathematics course set by Edexcel. This is a two year course with two examination papers in the summer of Year 11, one of which is a calculator paper and the other a non-calculator paper. These will test the core skills of Number, Algebra, Geometry, Statistics, Probability and Ratio.</p>

                            <li>It also continues to develop their skills in data handling and shape, space and measure.</li>
                            <li>Functional Mathematics is built into the course and is also the focus of a dedicated lesson every half term.</li>

                            <li>We teach the Edexcel linear course with pupils either following the foundation or higher specification. </li>
                            <li>The foundation course covers a range of topics in Number, Algebra, Shape and Data handling up to C grade. It emphasises pupils ability to use these skills and also be able to apply them to real life problems. </li>
                            <li>The higher course takes these topics further so pupils can tackle more complex problems, as well as giving them the basis they need to use Mathematics beyond GCSE.</li>
