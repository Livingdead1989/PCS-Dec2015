            <p>Park Community Enterprises lease a piece of farm land on which we have established a small holding.</p>
            <p>Students are taught to grow vegetables, look after and rear animals. The vegetables grown and in some cases meat from the farm is used in the school kitchen not only promoting healthy eating and also allowing students to make the connection with what they eat and where and how it is grown.</p>
