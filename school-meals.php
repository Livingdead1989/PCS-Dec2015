            <h3>Our Chef <small>- Steven Cross</small></h3>
            <p>For the past 16 years Steven has worked within the catering trade, after leaving school he went straight to Southdowns college and studied catering for 4 years. Cooking has always been his passion and from a very young age he cooked at home with his mother who is also a chef.</p>

            <p>Steven really loved college and the food he produced. He was rewarded with work placements in Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle, which was a great opportunity and a great honour working with some very talented chefs.</p>

            <p>After leaving college Steven focused on the highest level possible in fine dining and started working within AA rosetted establishments and Michelin star restaurants. This was extremely hard work, but Steven loved the challenge, Steven has worked in such places as 36 On The Quay and JSW, in Petersfield.</p>

            <p>For the past two years Steven has worked in Emsworth, at a local pub, in partnership with the owner to step up the quality. He achieved great success.</p>

            <p>Steven wanted a change and to experience new areas of catering so thought Park would be a great challenge and opportunity. Steven has worked incredibly hard to redefine school meals at Park Community School, and to date is recieving excellent results.</p>
