            <h3>Purpose of Study</h3>
            <p>Dance at Park helps students develop technical and expressive skills as well as their knowledge and understanding of Dance through performance, choreography and critical appreciation. It allows students to actively and physically demonstrate their abilities through exciting and engaging schemes of work which cover different styles and cultures of dance which prepare students for studying at GCSE and BTEC level.</p>

            <p>Dance uses movement symbolically as a fundamental form of human expression. It is both empowering and powerful as a form of non-verbal communication. The value of dance is the development of creative, imaginative, physical, emotional and intellectual capacities. Dance is both physical and expressive. Dance also helps students with essential life skills required after their secondary education and into the world of work or further education. These include skills such as cooperation, communication, leadership and problem solving skills alongside increased confidence in taking on new challenges.</p>

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p>Dance at Park focuses on dance composition, performance and appreciation of dance. Through exploring different contemporary dance techniques, professional contemporary dance set works and choreography, students develop their knowledge and understanding of contemporary dance.</p>

            <p>It also allows students to work independently as well as in teams to refine their movements and help build self-confidence, self-awareness as well as appreciating work of others.</p>
            
            <h3>Areas of Study</h3>
            <p>At KS3 students will have a basic introduction to the key skills required to compose, perform and appreciate dance . They will learn how to develop actions based around the theme of sport involving team work skills and working with others. The second unit of study is Bollywood dance which introduces students to a different culture involving performance skills and developing key actions and gestures.</p>

            <p>Students in year 8 are introduced to creating movements based around a stimulus and involves trio based work and the use of more challenging choreographic devices. Students begin to look at appreciation of other works which prepares them for studying Dance at a higher level.</p>

            <p>GCSE Dance focuses on dance composition, performance and appreciation of dance. Through exploring different contemporary dance techniques, professional contemporary dance set works and choreography, students develop their knowledge and understanding of contemporary dance.</p>

            <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Students look at physical fitness and effectiveness as a performer through safe practice/ technique classes/ rehearsal/ performance. They are encouraged to work together to create and perform pieces which challenge students and enable them to achieve their full potential.</p>

            <p><strong>Choreography:</strong> Students explore ideas based around a variety of stimuli through creating, improvising, developing and selecting movements appropriate to a theme or stimulus. Throughout the course they create a group piece of choreography as well as a solo, both of which are based on stimuli from professional Dance works.</p>

            <p><strong>Critical Appreciation:</strong> Students develop their critical skills through describing, analysing, interpreting and evaluating professional dance works. They will look at movement/set design/costume/lighting design/accompaniment. This culminates in a written examination which focuses on pulling together the practical knowledge they have acquired during the course.</p>
