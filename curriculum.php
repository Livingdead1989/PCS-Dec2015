            <h3>Curriculum Overview 2019-20</h2>
            <p>At Park Community School our curriculum prepares students for a long, successful and happy life. It is vital to us is that students leave with a basic understanding of many subjects. English and Maths are the most important and we strive to ensure each student achieves their personal best. We prepare students to follow a career of their choice by studying a range of relevant subjects in recognised qualifications that lead to further study at college and university, whether academic or vocational. We are currently reviewing the point at which students choose thier GCSE option courses and the number of options students have at KS4.</p>
            <p>Through the curriculum we seek opportunities to promote ‘joy, glee and delight’, in and out of lessons, and encourage the attitude that work should be finished with ‘polish and panache’ at all times. Our curriculum includes widening opportunities for learning through our smallholding, industrial unit, school kitchen, numerous trips in the UK and abroad. We ensure that the school environment, coupled with our high expectations, enhance wider learning about what it is to be a good citizen. Our pastoral approach and belief in the importance of each child means that personal development, understanding of our role as a citizen, democratic values, and the opportunities of the multicultural society that exists in Great Britain today are important parts of the rounded education we provide. Through the curriculum we continually seek opportunities to celebrate success and academic achievement.</p>
