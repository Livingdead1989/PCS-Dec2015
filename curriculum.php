            <h3>Curriculum Overview 2016-17</h2>
            <p>At Park Community School our curriculum prepares students for a long, successful and happy life. It is vital to us is that students leave secure in all subjects, particularly English and Maths. We ensure each student achieves their personal best. We prepare students to follow a career of their choice by studying a range of relevant subjects in recognised qualifications that leads to further study at college and university, whether academic or vocational.</p>
            <p>Through the curriculum we seek opportunities to promote ‘joy, glee and delight’, in and out of lessons, and encourage the attitude that work should be finished with ‘polish and panache’ at all times. Our curriculum includes widening opportunities for learning through our smallholding, industrial unit, numerous trips in the UK and abroad. We ensure that the school environment, coupled with our high expectations, enhance wider learning about what it is to be a good citizen. Our pastoral approach and belief in the importance of each child means that personal development, understanding of our role as a citizen, democratic values, and the opportunities of the multicultural society that exists in Great Britain today are important parts of the rounded education we provide. Through the curriculum we continually seek opportunities to celebrate success and academic achievement.</p>
