            <h3>Purpose of Study & Intention</h3>

            <blockquote>Geography is the subject which holds the key to our future <cite>Michael Palin</cite></blockquote>
            
            <p>Geography is arguably one of the most diverse, interesting and important subjects the national curriculum offers.</p>

            <p>Geography is primarily concerned with promoting an understanding of the nature of the Earth’s surface and more particularly the character of places, the complex nature of people’s relationships and interactions with their environment, and the importance in human affairs of the location and spatial organisation of human activities. This understanding includes the development of critical awareness of problems and conflicts in the geographical environment which relates to differing attitudes and situations. In this social context geography can also be a valuable medium for developing an understanding of the sensitivity to multicultural communities and societies.</p>

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p>Through the variety of teaching and learning strategies involved within geography, students will form an understanding of the different physical, human and environmental processes that are an integral part of our world.</p>

            <p>Geography seeks to explore the relationship between the Earth and its people through the study of PLACE, SPACE and ENVIRONMENT. Students will ask the questions WHERE, WHAT, WHO, HOW and WHY.</p>
            <p>The study of PLACE is aimed to allow students to describe and understand not only the location of physical and human features of the Earth, but also the processes, systems and interrelationships that create or influence those features.</p>
            <p>The study of SPACE teaches students to explore the relationships between places and patterns of activity arising from the use people make of the physical setting where they live and work.</p>
            <p>The study of the ENVIRONMENT embraces both its physical and human dimensions. Thus it addresses the resources, sometimes scarce and fragile that the Earth provides and on which all human life depends; the impact on those resources of human activities; and the wider social, economic, political and cultural consequences of the interrelationship between the two.</p>
            
            <p>The overall implications of sustainability both of land, resources, human actions etc. will promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding and values in students so they make responsible decisions, both individually and collectively, at both local and global scales, about the environment. </p>
