            <h4>Children and Young People Now Family Support Award 2018</h4>
            <p>We are proud to announce that on 21 November 2018, Park Community School was named as the 2018 winner of the Family Support Award at the Children and Young People Now Awards, for our MUNCH community food project.</p>
            <p>The CYPNOW awards are firmly established as the ‘gold standard’ in services for children, young people and families across the UK.  The award provides recognition and pride for teams and individuals who strive to improve young lives day in, day out and whose hard work and perseverance otherwise goes unnoticed and unsung.</p>
            <p>MUNCH addresses the problem of holiday hunger and offers free meals to children who normally receive free school meals during term time, providing a safe environment for children to come and have a meal during the school holidays.  Everyone is welcome from all local primary and secondary schools.  MUNCH has now expanded to include Thursday tea times and Sunday lunches.</p> 
            <p>In the judge’s opinion we have done the most in our category, to support whole families to help their children to lead healthy, happy and fulfilling lives safe from harm.</p>

    	<h4>Persimmon Building Futures Awards</h4>
    		<p>On Tuesday 8 October, Susan Parish, Business and Community Manager attended the Persimmon Building Futures Awards in York. Building Futures was launched to share £1 million to causes supporting under 18s across England. We were shortlisted for a prize towards funding for an activity track at Park Community School. As one of the finalists we were awarded a £5,000 donation on the night. Susan said:</p>
    		<p>“It was a fantastic night and we were made to feel so special and were surrounded by charities who carry out amazing things. Our thanks to Persimmon for providing these donations which are going to make such a huge difference to so many. Pleased to say, and so well deserved, locally Portsmouth Downs Syndrome Association were the big winners scooping the £100k first prize on the night”.</p>
