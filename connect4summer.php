			<h2>What is Connect4Summer?</h2>
			<p>In October 2019 the Department for Education published its invitation to bid for the local coordination of a free holiday provision fund which included activities and healthy food for disadvantaged children during 2020 summer holidays.</p>

			<p>During the summer of 2019 Romsey Community School and Park Community School successfully bid and provided a programme which was very successful. Therefore, we bid for the Holiday Activities Fund in summer 2020 and were delighted to hear we had won the bid once again.</p>

			<p>The project for 2020 is based on the pilot year and has been expanded to include more venues in Hampshire, Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight.</p>

			<h2>Press Release - Minister announces funding awarded to Park Community and Romsey Community Schools</h2>
			<p>News that a joint funding bid by Park Community School in Havant and Romsey Community School in Havant has been successful has been warmly welcomed.</p>
			<p>On 8 May 2019, Children and Families Minister, Nadhim Zahawi, announced that 11 coordinators will receive a share of £9.1m funding to provide 50,000 disadvantaged children with free meals and activities over the upcoming summer holidays.</p>
			<p>The Havant and Romsey schools are being given a grant to co-ordinate a programme called ‘Connect4Summer’ for children in 23 venues across Hampshire, including Portsmouth and Southampton.</p>
			<p>Connect4Summer will be providing an exciting programme that will include a range of sports activities, healthy cooking classes for children and their parents or carers, as well as additional support for our most vulnerable families who are in need.</p>
			<p>Headteacher of Park Community School, Christopher Anders, said: <em>“We are very excited and delighted to be involved in this large project supporting families with holiday child care and family fun days.”</em></p>
			<p>Headteacher Jonathan de Sausmarez of Romsey Community School said <em>“I am really pleased that the need for vulnerable families to have support and care over the summer holidays has been recognised. We want to make a real difference and we are very proud to support this much needed project.”</em></p>
			<p>Both Community Managers of each school, Susan Parish (Park Community School) and Jan Lefley (Romsey Community School) reported that they wanted to provide a programme that has a future legacy, that engages families and provides them with opportunities after the summer to continue with a variety of activities. Susan said <em>“It is very important to us that we continue to address holiday hunger and this programme enables us to reach large numbers of children and their families. We will also be able to offer children good quality, exciting activities and new opportunities whilst ensuring they are safe throughout the holidays.”</em></p>
