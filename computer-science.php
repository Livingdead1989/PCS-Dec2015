                    <h3>Why take GCSE (9-1) Computer Science?</h3>
                    <p>Computer Science is a very practical subject – students will be able to use the knowledge and skills they learn in the classroom on real-world problems. <br><br>
                    It’s also a highly creative subject that calls on learners to be inventive. To help us develop this engaging, modern qualification, we talked to companies like Microsoft, Google and Cisco; organisations like Computing At School (CAS) and also teachers and academics.</p>
                    <h3>The course at a glance</h3>
                    <p>The course is divided in to two components, Computer Systems and Computational Thinking.  Along side developing programming skills using Python, students will learn the fundamentals of computer hardware, software and networking as well as how to design and develop their own solutions to a real-world programming project.<br><br></p>
                    <h3>Computer Systems</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Study how processors work.</li>
                        <li>Investigate computer memory and storage.</li>
                        <li>Explore modern network layouts and how they function</li>
                        <li>Build skills in the ever important realm of cyber security</li>
                        <li>Investigate how types of software are used within computer systems.</li>
                        <li>Stretch wider comprehension of how computers and computing affect ethical, legal, cultural and environmental issues.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br>

                    <h3>Computational Thinking, Algorithms and Programming</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Study fundamental algorithms in computer science</li>
                        <li>Build a firm foundation in programming techniques.</li>
                        <li>Produce programs through diagrams</li>
                        <li>Thoroughly test programs and make them resistant to misuse.</li>
                        <li>Explore Boolean algebra (AND, OR, NOT).</li>
                        <li>Understand how we store data within computers in binary form.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br>

                    <h3>What will a student gain from this course? </h3>
