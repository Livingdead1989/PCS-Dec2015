                    <p>Computing sits at the cornerstone of the modern world, affecting the way we communicate and work as it encompasses Digital Literacy, IT and Computer Science. With this in mind our curriculum offers a pathway for our students to explore the use of applications and the creation of software to solve complex real-world problems through the use of computational thinking, which consists of abstraction, decomposition and pattern recognition.</p>

					<h3>Year 7</h3>
					<p>In year 7 students will develop their skills and knowledge of a range of software which will allow them to be creative and prepare them for further study.</p>
					<p>The curriculum includes opportunities to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Explore e-safety and gain an understanding of measure to protect personal data</li>
							<li>Experience cloud technologies used in the work place such as Microsoft Office and OneDrive</li>
							<li>Investigate computer systems and learn how the hardware functions</li>
							<li>Develop their knowledge of HTML the language behind the world wide web</li>
							<li>Acquire problem solving skills through programming challenges</li>
							<li>Learn how to handle technology purposefully and respectfully</li>
						</ul>

					<br>

					<h3>Year 8</h3>
					<p>Through Year 8 students will deepen their knowledge and proficiency of computing by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Learning to challenge and investigate what is shared online</li>
							<li>Understand the need for copyright</li>
							<li>Begin to appreciate binary, the language at the heart of computers which builds on their hardware knowledge</li>
							<li>Engage in creative problem-solving using flow diagrams and Python programming</li>
							<li>Extend their knowledge of HTML and methods of managing online content</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>GCSE Computer Science</h3>
					<p>Computer Science is a highly creative subject that calls on learners to be inventive. To help us develop this engaging, modern qualification, we talked to companies like Microsoft, Google and Cisco; organisations like Computing at School (CAS) and also teachers and other academics.</p>

					<p>At GCSE our students will follow the OCR Specification which explores a range of concepts which aims to equip and prepare candidates to complete programming projects with an awareness of the technologies that support their creation. This is achieved through two strands, Computer Systems and Computational Thinking.</p>

					<p>Understanding of computer systems will include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Studying how processors work.</li>
							<li>Investigating computer memory and storage.</li>
							<li>Exploring modern network layouts and how they function</li>
							<li>Building skills in the increasingly important realm of cyber security</li>
							<li>Investigating how types of software are used within computer systems</li>
							<li>Considering how computing can affect ethical, legal, cultural and environmental issues</li>
						</ul>

					<p>Computational Thinking is approached though:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Solve complex problems through abstraction and decomposition</li>
							<li>Studying fundamental algorithms in computer science </li>
							<li>Building a firm foundation in programming techniques</li>
							<li>Producing programs through planning via flow diagrams</li>
							<li>Thoroughly testing programs and make them resistant to misuse</li>
							<li>Exploring Boolean algebra (AND, OR, NOT).</li>
							<li>Understanding how we store data within computers using binary</li>
						</ul>


					<h3>What will a student gain from this course? </h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Valuable thinking and programming skills that are extremely attractive in the modern workplace</li>
							<li>A deep understanding of problem solving and experience in creating logical and efficient solutions</li>
							<li>Ability to demonstrate solutions to problems for other people to understand.</li>
							<li>A good grounding in mainstream computing theory and understanding</li>
						</ul>



					<h3>What could your child do next?</h3>
					<p>Our GCSE (9-1) Computer Science is effective preparation for a range of qualifications including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>AS Level Computer Science.</li>
							<li>A Level Computer Science.</li>
							<li>Cambridge Technicals â€“ IT Level 3 or Digital Media Level 3 </li>
						</ul>
					<p>(these are OCR vocational qualifications that offer an alternative to A levels for students aged 16+).</p>
					<p>It also provides a good grounding for other subject areas that require problem solving and analytical skills.</p>



					<h3>What Careers could a GCSE in Computer Science lead to?</h3>
					<p>There are many different careers that our qualifications could help students move towards.</p>
					<p>Here are some examples of sample career paths:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Data Analyst</li>
							<li>Games Developer</li>
							<li>Networks Manager</li>
							<li>Software Architect</li>
							<li>Robotics Engineer</li>
							<li>Multimedia Programmer</li>
							<li>Cyber Security</li>
							<li>Forensic Computing</li>
							<li>Animator</li>
							<li>Web Design</li>
							<li>App development</li>
							<li>Nanotechnologist</li>
						</ul>
