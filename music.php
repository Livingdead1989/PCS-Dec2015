            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Music at Park enables students to develop technical and expressive skills in performance and composing in addition to gaining wide subject knowledge of musical genres through listening and appraising activities. Students in KS3 study a wide range of topics and instruments discovering their creative potential before specialising in their preferred instrument in KS4.</p>

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p>Here at Park our aim is to provide a challenging and rewarding course that is taught in mixed ability groups throughout Years 7 and 8 and follows an essentially practical experience for students. As a creative subject it helps to achieve a balance in the curriculum.</p>

            <h3>Areas of Study</h3>
            <p>The Key Stage 3 curriculum at Park is broad and enables students to build up a good repertoire of songs and improve their vocal skills, learn basic keyboard skills and progress to playing with both hands. In years 7 and 8, projects last between 5-7 weeks of performing, composing and listening activities, where pupils have opportunities to work individually, in pairs and in larger groups. They are encouraged to evaluate and improve upon their ideas as well as discussing the work of their peers in a positive, supportive atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Students will have the opportunity to experience a range of instruments, learning about a wide variety of topics including world music, popular music as well as the fundamentals of western music.</p>

            <p>Examples of units of work include Rhythm, Melody, Samba and Showcasing.</p>

            <p>We set homework at KS3 which is a research-based assignment and as work is largely practical, we ask pupils to practice anything they are currently working on in lessons. Students are welcome to use the music facilities before and after school to rehearse.</p>

            <p>Once in KS4 students then begin studying for the RSL Level 2 Certificate in performance for Music Practitioners which consists of three units; Composition, Music Knowledge and Live Performance.</p>
