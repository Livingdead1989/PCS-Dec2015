            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>As a department we aim to create an inspirational working environment, where we strive to actively engage students in learning. Where participation and achievement are measured, monitored and celebrated.</p>

            <p>We aim to provide a challenging, disciplined and safe environment for high quality learning and teaching, with an extensive selection of activities, through route ways, to ensure each student is offered a stimulating and relevant choice in their learning.</p>

            <p>Students who thrive in and enjoy PE will be encouraged to take BTEC Sport as an option at Year 9. Here they will further develop skills learnt at Key Stage 3 and apply them to more theoretical concepts with the subject, such as anatomy and physiology and sports analysis.</p>

            <p>By the end of their physical education at Park, the students should have developed a personal commitment to, and genuine passion for, maintaining their health and well-being into adult life.</p> 

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <ul class="circle">
                <li>Provide outstanding teaching and learning for all students.</li>

                <li>Inspire students to achieve academically and within sporting environments.</li>

                <li>Develop competitive, successful sporting teams that encourage students to develop personal qualities of commitment, fairness, enthusiasm, and an appreciation of honest competition and good sportsmanship.</li>

                <li>Allow for the acquisition and application of vital transferable skills to a range of sporting activities.</li>

                <li>Develop an appreciation of skilful and creative performances in a variety of sports activities.</li>

                <li>Promote the awareness, understanding and appreciation of how physical activity benefits the students social, moral, physical, spiritual and cognitive development.</li>

                <li>Allow learners to achieve their full potential, recognize the uniqueness of the individual and encourage self-worth.</li>

                <li>Inspire enjoyment of physical activity to prepare students for participating in physical activity in their adult life.</li>

                <li>Encourage the development of a variety of desirable personal qualities such as politeness, perseverance, honesty, integrity, a sense of justice, initiative, and independence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Teaching and Learning in PE</h3>
            <p>PE lessons will take many forms which will engage and challenge students. PE teachers will use a combination of drill and game approaches to ensuring that students understand the requirements of certain sports and physical activities. Key skills such as leadership, teamwork and positive communication are encouraged throughout, and students will frequently be expected to problem solve as part of a group to overcome a scenario provided to them.</p>

            <p>Students who want to improve further will be encouraged to attend extra-curricular opportunities, and at times be asked to represent the school across a number of sports. Those students that are outstanding performers may be asked to take on leadership roles within lessons, with the opportunity to be part of the sports ambassador programme. </p>
            


            <h3>Areas of Study</h3>
            <p>The specific aims of our core PE program are to enable pupils to improve their physical performance by practicing and refining techniques which are fundamental to physical activities, of which they can then master. Also, to ensure they have a deep understanding for how their bodies respond to exercise and effective ways to train for their individual needs.</p>

            <h5><strong>KS3 - KeyStage 3</strong></h5>
            <p>Within Key Stage 3 PE students experience a wide range of activities and sports which allow for independence and resilience to be developed as well as a deeper understanding for various rules and regulations of sports and how their bodies adapt and adjust during exercise.</p>
            <p>Sports offered within this key stage fall within 3 pathways; Competitive, traditional and health related exercise of which the students choose the pathway they would like to pursue.</p>

            <ul class="circle"><strong>Activities include:</strong>
                <li>Basketball</li>
                <li>Netball</li>
                <li>Tag Rugby</li>
                <li>American Flag Football</li>
                <li>Badminton</li>
                <li>Athletics</li>
                <li>Rounders</li>
                <li>Football</li>
                <li>Fitness</li>
                <li>Lacrosse</li>
                <li>Volleyball</li>

                <li>Aerobics</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Assessment and feedback</h5>
            <p>Multiple choice testing will take place half termly with structured end of unit/topic teacher assessment, focusing on specific theory content which is mapped across the year to establish a basic understanding of key elements (muscles, body systems, components of fitness and methods of training). Teacher assessment will also be conducted half termly to assess practical performance in each discipline.</p>

            <p>Feedback is given as regular verbal feedback throughout practical lessons. Students will be able to identify working levels and how to improve through verbal feedback and practical application. Models are used through teacher and student demonstrations enabling improvement of performance analysis.</p> 



            <h5><strong>KS4 - KeyStage 4</strong></h5>
            <p>Within Key Stage 4 PE, students can experience a high level of independence and a range of sports of which are focused towards their interests. Within Key Stage 4 we are developing students to have the confidence to continue exercising when they leave Park. We continue to develop their understanding of a range of sports, rules and regulations. We look in depth at both short and long-term benefits of exercising. We do this through 3 pathways; competitive, traditional and health related exercise, of which the students choose the pathway they would like to pursue.</p> 

            <ul class="circle"><strong>Activities include:</strong>

            <h5><strong>KS4 – Key Stage 4 Examination PE</strong> - BTEC Level 2 Award in Sport</h5>
            <p>BTEC Level 2 Award in Sport - This course will encourage personal development through practical participation and performance in a range of sports and exercise activities. It gives students a wider understanding and appreciation of health-related fitness, sports and exercise through a selection of specialist units. Throughout the course students are encouraged to develop their people, communication, planning and team working skills. Students are guided through units of study which relate strongly to real life context.</p>
            <p>This course is made up of 4 units, whereby 25% of the total grade is an online exam which is externally set. The remaining units are coursework based, where students will be required to compile a portfolio of evidence to meet the assessment criteria.</p>

            <p><strong>Main topics students study:</strong><p>
            
            <ul class="circle"><strong>Year 9 - 11</strong>

            <h5>Assessment and feedback – </h5>
            <p>Online exams are completed in BTEC Sport by students to ensure unit achievement this is through developed knowledge from KS3 theory input. Practical assessment is completed through BTEC criteria of Pass / Merit in relation to performance and application of skills within practise and competitive situations.</p>

            <p>A tracker is used throughout every lesson for immediate feedback on progress to course / unit completion and to what grade. Students can reflect on current working grade compared to projection and are able to then implement feedback and next step criteria effectively. Further feedback takes place after students have completed units of work at the end of each term/deadline which they are then issued this feedback form and 15 days to implement improvements.</p>

            <p>Regular feedback is given in books and on summative assessment forms at the end of units/assignments. It is also seen every lesson through verbal diagnostic conversations with suggested improvements. Books show specific feedback which stretch the level of understanding which is also specific to the attainment criteria for that task. Exemplar assignments are used throughout the course to promote independence and implementation of I do, you do, and we do. This is measured through progress on the class tracker and shown in improved work within portfolios.</p>
